NOTE:  v2.30 Series of the software is ONLY for the legacy hardware - namely the old 7-Segment LED display with the HT16K33 controller.  V2.40 + series of the software uses a new display type (TM1637).  The two are not interchangeable. 

ANOTHER NOTE:  Due to the new dimmer code, you may need to configure this as you'll notice the display may dim and your BRT setting won't stick. Simply access the new DIM menu option and change the logic HI or LOW.
